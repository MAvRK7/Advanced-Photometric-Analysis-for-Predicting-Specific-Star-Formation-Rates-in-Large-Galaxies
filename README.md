# Photometric Analysis for Predicting Star Formation Rates in Large Galaxies Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques

Project Overview

This project explores the prediction of Star Formation Rates (SFRs) in large galaxies using only photometric data, leveraging advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques. By utilizing the extensive dataset collected by Delli Veneri et al. (2019) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS-DR7), we aim to demonstrate the efficacy of these methods as alternatives to traditional spectroscopy for estimating SFRs.
